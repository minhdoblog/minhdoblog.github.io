      <!-- General Introduction -->
      In this post, I’ll share my travel experience across six European countries in just 11 days. Starting from Singapore, I visited the United Kingdom 
      (London, Oxford), France (Paris), Belgium (Brussels), Germany (Frankfurt), Switzerland (Zurich), and Italy (Milan and Rome). I’ll walk you through the details 
      of applying for UK and Schengen visas, booking flights, arranging transportation and accommodation, and exploring the must-see attractions in each city. Whether 
      you're planning a similar trip or just curious about my journey, this post covers everything you need to know for an unforgettable European adventure.
    </p>
    
    <p class="intro-text">
      <!-- General Applying Visa -->
      <strong>Applying for Visas</strong><br>
      As a Vietnamese citizen living in Singapore, I needed visas to enter both the United Kingdom and Schengen countries. I applied for these visas about 1.5 months in advance while in Singapore.
      <br><br>
      First, I applied for the UK visa, then proceeded to apply for the Schengen visa at the French Embassy. Interestingly, you don't need to have a flight or hotel booked in advance; a booking quote is sufficient.
      <br><br>
      For the UK visa, I submitted my application online via the UK Embassy website in Singapore. After that, I booked an appointment to submit 
      my physical documents through the VFS Centre. It took just five days for me to receive my UK visa, which cost S$224 and was valid for 6 months 
      with multiple entries. The required documents included the online application, my passport, payslips, a bank statement, and a travel itinerary.
      <br><br>
      For the Schengen visa, I applied at the French Embassy, as I would be traveling from the UK to France. Unlike the UK visa, the Schengen visa 
      required travel insurance for the duration of my stay in Schengen countries. I purchased travel insurance 
      through <a href="https://swisscare.com/en/product/low-cost-schengen-visa-insurance" target="_blank">Swisscare</a>, which offers affordable coverage for Schengen visa applicants.
    </p>
    

    <p class="intro-text">
      <!-- General Booking: Flight ticket, hotel, transportation -->
      <strong>Booking Hotel and Transportation</strong><br>

      After receiving my UK visa, I booked my flights from Singapore to London (United Kingdom), with a return from Rome (Italy) to Singapore. 
      It was a bit risky, as I was still waiting for my French visa, but I took the chance, thinking that my France visa would be approved. I booked with China Eastern Airlines, with a layover in Shanghai (China), because they offered affordable prices (S$786 for the round-trip from Singapore to London and back from Rome to Singapore). 
    </p>
    <p class="intro-text">

      Once I received my French visa, I sat down with my companion for this trip to book hotels and arrange transportation between the European countries. For hotels, we used Agoda and Booking.com, choosing accommodations near the city center (within 4 km) to make it easier to visit key attractions.
    </p>

      <p class="intro-text">

      There are three main options for traveling between European countries: bus, train, and flight. Buses are the most affordable option and can be booked closer to the travel date. Train and flight tickets tend to be more expensive, especially when booked last-minute. I recommend using the Omio app to book transportation. 
    
      For my trip, I flew from Singapore to London (United Kingdom), took a bus from London to Paris (France), then from Paris to Brussels (Belgium), and from Brussels to Frankfurt (Germany). I continued by train from Frankfurt (Germany) to Zurich (Switzerland), then a bus from Zurich (Switzerland) to Milan (Italy), a train from Milan to Rome, and finally flew from Rome back to Singapore.
    </p>

      <strong>London and Oxford in United Kingdom</strong><br>
      <br>
      <strong>Day 1: Flight from Singapore to London</strong>
      <br>
      From Singapore, I flew to Shanghai, where I had a 5-hour layover. During the first flight, I was served a free meal. After the layover, I boarded another flight for a 14-hour journey to London, and was provided with two free meals on this second flight. I arrived in London at 6 pm.
      <br><br>
      At Heathrow Airport, I bought a 30GB SIM card for £30. The SIM card gives me 18GB of data for use in the UK, with the remaining 12GB available for use in other European countries. After that, I took the Elizabeth Line train, which took about 45 minutes to reach my hotel located near Soho, right in the city center.
      
      <br><br>
      <strong>Day 2: Explore Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge and  Greenwich Royal Observatory in London</strong>
      <br>

      In the morning, I took a 25-minute bus ride to visit Big Ben, one of the most iconic landmarks of the United Kingdom. 
      From there, I headed to Buckingham Palace, the official residence of the British monarch.
      <br><br>
      

      Afterward, I visited Platform 9 ¾ at King's Cross Station, a fictional location from the Harry Potter series, 
      which was a magical experience for any fan.
      <br><br>

      For lunch, I explored the vibrant area around Tower Bridge and the Thames River. Then, I took a bus to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, where the Prime Meridian
       (zero-degree longitude) passes through, marking a significant point on the globe.
      <br><br>

      In the evening, I strolled through Soho, a lively neighborhood known for its bustling Chinatown and array of bars. 
      It’s a popular spot, especially at night, and offers a great atmosphere to end the day.

      <br>
      <strong>Day 3: Day Trip to Oxford University</strong>
      <br>

      At 7 a.m., I took a bus from London to Oxford University for a day trip, with the journey taking about two hours. 
      Upon arrival, my friends, who are studying and working at Oxford, gave me a guided tour of the campus, sharing fascinating 
      insights into its history, culture, and the unique study environment. 
      The landscape of Oxford was breathtaking, almost like something out of a fairy tale.
      <br><br>


      I visited Christ Church College, one of the most beautiful and iconic landmarks in Oxford. 
      Afterward, I enjoyed lunch at a charming restaurant on campus, renowned for being a favorite spot of 
      U.S. President Bill Clinton during his time at Oxford. 
      I also had a coffee at one of the lovely campus cafes, perfect for relaxing and soaking in the atmosphere.
      <br><br>


      In the afternoon, I continued exploring other colleges, visited museums and gardens, and admired the autumn scenery. 
      I spent some time chatting with friends over coffee on campus, enjoying the peaceful surroundings.
      <br><br>


      At 6 p.m., I took the bus back to London. Upon arriving, I checked out of my hotel and caught a bus at 11 p.m. 
      to head to Paris. After an 8-hour journey, I reached Paris at 9 a.m. the following day.
      <br><br>

      <strong>Tips:</strong> Pay by credit card—there’s no need for cash. Purchase a SIM card that works across all European countries, 
      and use your credit card for bus and train rides within cities.

      <strong>Visit Paris, France</strong><br>
      <strong>Day 4: Visit Effel Tower, Louvre Museum, take ferry on Seine River and visit Arc de Triomphe   </strong><br>

      In the morning, I checked into my hotel and had lunch before taking the train to visit the Eiffel Tower. Afterward, I explored Paris Church and then made my way to the Louvre Museum. At 6:30 p.m., I took a ferry along the Seine River to see Paris at night. While it was a bit chilly, the view was beautiful. However, I recommend taking the trip between 3 and 4 p.m. for a better daytime view. 

      <br><br>
      Later, I had dinner at a restaurant near the Eiffel Tower, where I tried some classic Parisian dishes, including beef steak and a glass of red wine—just like the French do.
  
      <br><br>
      After dinner, I visited the Arc de Triomphe, the famous monument built by Napoleon to commemorate his army's victories.    
      <br><br>

      <strong>Day 5: Visit Les Invalides and Palace of Versailles </strong><br>

      In the morning, I visited Les Invalides, the historic complex where Napoleon Bonaparte is laid to rest. I bought a ticket to see Napoleon's magnificent tomb and to explore the fascinating Army Museum housed within the site.
      <br><br>
      In the afternoon, I took a train to the Palace of Versailles, the opulent former residence of French royalty. The palace itself was awe-inspiring, and the expansive gardens surrounding it were equally breathtaking.  
      <br><br>
      For dinner, I met a friend at a cozy ramen restaurant in Paris. We enjoyed a delicious meal while engaging in a lively conversation about life in the city.   
      <br><br>
      At 11 p.m., I boarded a bus bound for Brussels, Belgium. After a long journey, I finally arrived in Brussels at 5 a.m.

      <strong>Brussels, Belgium: visit Grand Place, Bourse Building, headquarters of the European Union and Palace of Justice </strong><br>

      At 7 a.m., I took a bus to visit Grand Place, a famous square known for its stunning Gothic architecture. I also explored the Bourse Building, home to the Brussels Stock Exchange. 
      <br><br>
      Afterward, I visited the Berlaymont Building, which houses the headquarters of the European Union. I then took a train to the Palace of Justice, another impressive landmark in Brussels.
  
      <br><br>

      <strong>Frankfurt, Germany</strong><br>

      At 12 p.m., I boarded a bus from Brussels to Frankfurt, Germany. Although I was expecting to arrive by 7 p.m. and explore the city at night, the bus was delayed due to heavy traffic, and we didn’t reach Frankfurt until 9 p.m. Once I checked into my hotel, I went out for dinner and relaxed after the long journey.      
      <br><br>
      The following day, I took a train from Frankfurt to Zurich, Switzerland, one of my main destinations. The journey took about 4 hours.

       The following day, I took a train from Frankfurt to Zurich, Switzerland, one of my main destinations. The journey took about 4 hours.     
       <br><br>
       <strong>Tips:</strong> it’s convenient to purchase 1- or 2-day train and bus tickets, and using a credit card is recommended since cash is often unnecessary.

      <strong>Visit Zurich, Switzerland</strong><br>
      <strong>Day 7: visit Zurich Lake, ETH Zurich University, walk along Limmat river</strong><br>

      I took an 8 a.m. train from Frankfurt, Germany, and arrived in Zurich, Switzerland, at 12 p.m. The views from the window during the journey were stunning, showcasing the natural beauty of the landscape. After checking into my hotel, I took a tram to Lake Zurich, which was absolutely beautiful, surrounded by water, mountains, and clouds.
      <br><br>
      Next, I visited ETH Zurich, one of the world’s leading universities and met a friend working here. He gave me a tour of the campus, introducing me to the student life, work culture, and life in Switzerland. The university is located right in the heart of Zurich, with a breathtaking view of the lake—it's truly a lovely setting.  
      <br><br>
      In the evening, I took a walk along the Limmat River in Zurich, enjoying the city views at night. Later, I hopped on a tram with no particular destination in mind. The tram took me on a spontaneous exploration of the city, offering a unique perspective of Zurich through the window at night.
      <br><br>

      <strong>Day 8: Visit Mount Titlis in the Alps</strong><br>

      At 8 a.m., I took a train for a 1.5-hour journey to visit the famous Mount Titlis in the Swiss Alps. The round-trip ticket cost 80 Swiss Francs, and the views from the train were simply breathtaking. Switzerland’s nature is truly unparalleled.      
       <br><br>
       Upon reaching Titlis, I took a cable car up to the mountain peak, which sits at 10,000 feet. The area was covered in snow and ice, offering an incredible mountain view. It was a popular spot for skiing, with many people enjoying the slopes. After exploring the area, I took the train back to Zurich.      
       <br><br>
       The following day, I took a bus at 5 a.m. for a 4-hour journey from Zurich to Milan, Italy, arriving at 8 a.m.
       <br><br>

       <strong>Tips:</strong> buy 1 or 2 days ticket for train and bus, use credit card and don’t need cash. Don’t have barrier to enter public transportation but staff will random check and fine 100 frank if we don’t have ticket
       <br><br>

        <!-- General Applying Visa -->
        <strong>Visit Milan and Rome in Italy</strong><br>
        <strong>Day 9:</strong><br>
  
        I took a 5 a.m. bus from Zurich to Milan, Italy, arriving at 8 a.m. The trip lasted about 4 hours. In Milan, I visited the iconic Duomo di Milano (Milan Cathedral) and Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, a center of global fashion. The architecture of both places was stunning, and the gallery is home to many luxury fashion brands. In the morning, it was incredibly crowded with people dressed in stylish outfits. I wandered around, taking in the lively atmosphere, and stopped at a famous café to enjoy a delicious cake.     
        <br><br>
        At 1:30 p.m., I took a train from Milan and arrived in Rome at 5:30 p.m. After having dinner at a Chinese restaurant and checking into my hotel, I visited the Trevi Fountain, one of the most famous landmarks in Italy. Unfortunately, the fountain was closed for renovation. Nevertheless, I walked around the area, enjoyed some ice cream, and then returned to my hotel.      
        <br><br>

        <strong>Day 10 and 11: Visit Colosseum and Vatican, then flight back to Singapore</strong><br>
  
        At 8 a.m., I visited the Colosseum, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It was an incredible sight, though very crowded. I had to wait in line for about 40 minutes to get inside. The Colosseum was once the arena where gladiators fought each other and battled dangerous animals, and it felt like stepping into history.      
         <br><br>
         In the afternoon, I went to Vatican City to visit St. Peter’s Basilica, the center of Christianity. The line was long, and I had to wait about an hour to enter. Inside, I marveled at the stunning architecture and artwork. I also visited the tombs of past Popes, which was a humbling experience.        
         <br><br>
   
         At 6 p.m., I took a train from central Rome to the airport and departed Italy at 8:30 p.m. for Singapore. After a 2-hour transit, I arrived in Singapore at 10 p.m. the following day.
         <br><br>
         <strong>Tips:</strong> Be sure to have cash on hand to pay the additional 10% tax for hotels in Rome.
