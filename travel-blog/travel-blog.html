      <!-- General Introduction -->
      In this post, I’ll share my travel experience across six European countries in just 11 days. Starting from Singapore, I visited the United Kingdom 
      (London, Oxford), France (Paris), Belgium (Brussels), Germany (Frankfurt), Switzerland (Zurich), and Italy (Milan and Rome). I’ll walk you through the details 
      of applying for UK and Schengen visas, booking flights, arranging transportation and accommodation, and exploring the must-see attractions in each city. Whether 
      you're planning a similar trip or just curious about my journey, this post covers everything you need to know for an unforgettable European adventure.
    </p>

      <!-- General Applying Visa -->
      <strong>Applying for Visas</strong><br>
      As a Vietnamese citizen living in Singapore, I needed visas to enter both the United Kingdom and Schengen countries. I applied for these visas about 1.5 months in advance while in Singapore.
      <br><br>
      First, I applied for the UK visa, then proceeded to apply for the Schengen visa at the French Embassy. Interestingly, you don't need to have a flight or hotel booked in advance; a booking quote is sufficient.
      <br><br>
      For the UK visa, I submitted my application online via the UK Embassy website in Singapore. After that, I booked an appointment to submit 
      my physical documents through the VFS Centre. It took just five days for me to receive my UK visa, which cost S$224 and was valid for 6 months 
      with multiple entries. The required documents included the online application, my passport, payslips, a bank statement, and a travel itinerary.
      <br><br>
      For the Schengen visa, I applied at the French Embassy, as I would be traveling from the UK to France. Unlike the UK visa, the Schengen visa 
      required travel insurance for the duration of my stay in Schengen countries. I purchased travel insurance 
      through <a href="https://swisscare.com/en/product/low-cost-schengen-visa-insurance" target="_blank">Swisscare</a>, which offers affordable coverage for Schengen visa applicants.

      <!-- General Booking: Flight ticket, hotel, transportation -->
      <strong>Booking Hotel and Transportation</strong><br>

      After receiving my UK visa, I booked my flights from Singapore to London (United Kingdom), with a return from Rome (Italy) to Singapore. 
      It was a bit risky, as I was still waiting for my French visa, but I took the chance, thinking that my France visa would be approved. I booked with China Eastern Airlines, with a layover in Shanghai (China), because they offered affordable prices (S$786 for the round-trip from Singapore to London and back from Rome to Singapore). 
    </p>
    <p class="intro-text">

      Once I received my French visa, I sat down with my companion for this trip to book hotels and arrange transportation between the European countries. For hotels, we used Agoda and Booking.com, choosing accommodations near the city center (within 4 km) to make it easier to visit key attractions.
    </p>

      <p class="intro-text">

      There are three main options for traveling between European countries: bus, train, and flight. Buses are the most affordable option and can be booked closer to the travel date. Train and flight tickets tend to be more expensive, especially when booked last-minute. I recommend using the Omio app to book transportation. 
    
      For my trip, I flew from Singapore to London (United Kingdom), took a bus from London to Paris (France), then from Paris to Brussels (Belgium), and from Brussels to Frankfurt (Germany). I continued by train from Frankfurt (Germany) to Zurich (Switzerland), then a bus from Zurich (Switzerland) to Milan (Italy), a train from Milan to Rome, and finally flew from Rome back to Singapore.
