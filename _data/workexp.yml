  intro: "In the Autonomous Drone in Maze project, I built autonomous drone system focused on real-time sensing, mapping, planning, and navigation 
  within a maze environment. My work involved creating a seamless simulation environment through the integration of Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) pipelines 
  and the implementation of real-time algorithms. This setup allowed drone flight simulation on a workstation while running SLAM, mapping, planning, 
  navigation, and control modules in real-time on the Jetson.

I optimized and allocated computing resources across the embedded CPU-DLA-GPU, which enhanced the performance of SLAM, 
mapping, planning, navigation, and object detection. These efforts enabled the drone to achieve efficient flight speeds 
and navigate through dense obstacle environments, showcasing the system's capability to operate effectively in challenging conditions on the Jetson."

  intro: "In the Infrastructure to Vehicle (I2V) Communication for Driving Assistance project, I led the development of real-time, 
  resource-efficient computer vision algorithms to facilitate urban traffic management through embedded systems, optimizing for both 
  cost and power consumption. Leveraging object detection and tracking techniques, I spearheaded the analysis of traffic flows across 
  19 camera feeds, significantly contributing to smarter city infrastructure.

My role also encompassed the design and refinement of a lightweight AI model capable of vehicle tracking and crowd counting. 
This innovation empowered four Odroid N2+ edge devices to simultaneously process live feeds from nine cameras and establish 
seamless communication with Autonomous Vehicles. Furthermore, I guided and mentored a team of 15 student assistants in the nuances 
of AI data handling, including meticulous preparation and annotation."

  timeline: "School of Computer Science and Engineering, NTU, Dec 2016 - Dec 2020"
  intro: "In the Sensing and Management for Agile Transport project, I played a pivotal role in setting up a comprehensive camera network, 
  configuring 27 cameras across 8 key locations to capture high-quality video data for traffic analytics. My work involved developing 
  and refining lightweight computer vision algorithms, training, and optimizing AI models on embedded platforms for real-time 
  applications such as traffic density estimation, illegal parking and entry detection, crowd counting, and implementing vision-based 
  smart traffic light systems.

I also led the supervision of algorithmic enhancements and conducted extensive field testing on various embedded platforms 
including Odroid XU4 and Odroid N2+, significantly contributing to traffic management advancements both at NTU and across Singapore.

  timeline: "School of Computer Science and Engineering, NTU, Aug 2020 - Dec 2022"
  intro: "In my work on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), I enhanced the robustness of visual SLAM 
  by advancing dynamic outlier removal techniques within RGB-D and stereo data, which significantly improved pose 
  estimation and map precision. I also progressed loop closure detection for long-term SLAM by integrating location semantics, 
  reducing false matches and efficiently deploying these improvements on embedded systems..
