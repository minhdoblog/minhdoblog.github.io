  intro: "The Virtual Right of Way (VROW) serves as a groundbreaking initiative to assess the viability of 
  a priority lane system for buses on two-lane roads. These roads lack dedicated bus lanes owing to 
  constraints such as insufficient bus volumes and limited spatial availability. 
  The innovative core of VROW lies in its approach that leverages technology to prompt drivers to 
  yield the right of way to buses by using Variable Message Signs (VMS)"

  intro: "This project aims to study the viability of I2V communication for driving assistance in public transportation 
  facilities. In particular, visual analytics performed on the edge computing devices mounted on the public transportation 
  infrastructure will be communicated to vehicles (such as Autonomous Vehicles) to enhance their navigation in the vicinity."
